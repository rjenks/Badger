Con-Badges
======

Application for creating unique event badges for attendees using SVG templates. Many events use a variety of badges for different attendee types and access levels. This software allows you to generate personalized badges of a variety of types.  Badges can be printed from attendee data loaded from a CSV file or by polling a web service you provide.  The badges are defined by types. Each type can have a separate SVG template file to define it's appearance. The SVG is dynamically modified based on the loaded badge data. For example the SVG template might include a text element named "FIRST_NAME" which is replaced with the person's first name. In addition, the software can generate a QR Code and a Barcode based on user data which can be positioned in the SVG template.
